## Introduction 

For many centuries, readers have been captivated by the timeless Chinese literature, "Journey to the West". This novel takes its readers on an unforgettable journey with its animated characters and profound symbolism. Though there is uncertainty surrounding the authorship of this work, Wu Cheng’en is suspected to be responsible for it as it was published during China’s Ming Dynasty in the 16th century. Alongside other literature such as "Romance of Three Kingdoms," "Dream of Red Chamber," and "Water Margin", this piece has established itself as one of China's Four Great Classical Novels. 

The story follows Tang Sanzang, a devoted Buddhist monk on a pilgrimage quest to secure sacred scriptures that will uplift humanity. He travels through arduous terrain towards Xi Tian, accompanied by his companions: Sun Wukong (the Monkey King), Zhu Bajie (Pig), and Sha Wujing (the water buffalo). Together, they embark on a dangerous adventure full of humor, trials, and robust personalities, with each companion adding complexity to the overall story. This journey is a testament to the enduring power, which inspires and challenges readers' creativity for centuries. In recent years, countless adaptations of TV shows, short-form videos, and movies allowed the work to earn its worldwide recognition.
Inspiration

The decision to undertake a project centered around "Journey to the West" was a natural one, stemming from a lifetime of countless interactions with this captivating adventure that began in my childhood. From the enchanting TV show adaptations to toys of Sun Wukong on the bookshelves, its influence has left an unforgettable mark on my imagination. The iconic trio of characters in the story, Tang Sanzang, Sun Wukong, and Zhu Bajie, have both entertained and fascinated me, drawing me further into their world with each encounter.

Undertaking this project offered me a distinctive opportunity to delve into the profound depths of the text, utilizing the skills and tools acquired throughout this semester. As someone who learns visually, the application of network analysis serves as the perfect gateway for me to explore the intricacies of the characters and their relationships. Using Gephi, python, and analytical tools, I aim to breathe new life into the narrative, extracting hidden information, and shedding light on the intricately woven threads of its plot. By examining the characters' connections and interactions through the lens of a network, I seek to uncover deeper insights and enhance the audience's appreciation of a work that held great significance in my own life. 

## Data collection

The text file of "Journey to the West" was obtained from the Gutenberg project, while the character list and location data were extracted from the Wikipedia page titled "西游记角色列表". To address discrepancies arising from different translation versions of the English text, the Chinese version was employed for ease of matching and scraping the text for characters and event data. Although the utilization of the Chinese text helped to resolve some name discrepancies, issues in the naming of places persisted between the Wikipedia list and the text. These discrepancies primarily stemmed in variations in the full names of places and characters, as the text occasionally used abbreviations or nicknames instead. To mitigate these discrepancies, each name was searched within the text to verify its presence, and adjustments were made to replace the full name with the corresponding abbreviation in the individual character or place text file. 

Following an extensive examination of the list, a total of 67 characters and 50 locations were successfully identified. Although certain characters and locations were mentioned on the Wikipedia page, they were not found during the search through the text. This discrepancy could be attributed to unfamiliar abbreviations or differences in the utilized book version. Attempts were made to find natural language processing packages, such as SpaCy, capable of conducting name searches. However, like SpaCy, the availability of NLP packages supporting Chinese name search was limited. Efforts were made to employ jieba for name identification. However, due to my limited experience with Python, its usage proved challenging. Consequently, jieba was not employed, and only names and locations that were confirmed and identified were utilized. 

## Method

In the python code, a series of methods were employed to process and analyze the text of "Journey to the West" in a systematic and comprehensive manner. The process was carried out in two iterations, focusing on character interactions and character-event interactions, respectively.

Initially, the raw text file was used, and newline characters were removed for seamless processing. A separate file containing a comprehensive list of character names was also used, allowing for the creation of a dictionary that mapped each character name to a unique identifier. This facilitated efficient referencing and organization of the data.

In the first iteration, the code focused on character interactions. Regular expressions were utilized to identify occurrences of character names within the text, and a text window of 100 characters was extracted to analyze contextual information surrounding each character's appearance. A network dictionary was constructed to store co-occurrence information, capturing the relationships between characters. A graph representation of the network was then created using the networkx library, with nodes representing characters and edges denoting co-occurrences. The resulting network provided insights into the dynamics and relationships between characters.

In the second iteration, the analysis expanded to include character-event interactions. Like the first iteration, the text was processed to identify character names. Additionally, event data was extracted by searching for specific keywords or patterns related to events and associating them with the relevant characters. The co-occurrence analysis was extended to incorporate both character and event interactions, capturing the interplay between characters and events within the narrative. The resulting network offered a comprehensive understanding of the story's structure and the influence of events on character interactions.

Two spreadsheets were generated for each iteration. The first spreadsheet stored node information, including character IDs, names, and Pinyin romanizations. The second spreadsheet captured edge information, such as source and target IDs, edge weights, and types. 

Once the spreadsheets containing node and edge information were generated, they were loaded into Gephi. With the loaded spreadsheets, various statistical tests and centrality measures were applied to gain insights into the characteristics of the constructed networks. Three statistical measures were used: degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality.
Degree centrality measures the number of connections a node has in the network. It represents the popularity or connectivity of a node. Higher degree centrality values indicate nodes that are more connected to others within the network (Sayama, 2015). Betweenness centrality quantifies the extent to which a node lies on the shortest paths between other nodes in the network. Nodes with high betweenness centrality act as intermediaries, facilitating communication and information flow between other nodes. Closeness centrality measures how close a node is to other nodes in terms of geodesic distance, i.e., the shortest path lengths (Sayama, 2015). Nodes with high closeness centrality are more central and have quicker access to information or resources within the network.

By conducting separate analyses for character interactions and character-event interactions, the code provided a comprehensive approach to network construction. This approach allowed for a focused examination of each aspect individually, leading to more accurate and insightful network representations.

## Results 

### Character to Character interaction

Focusing on the first network on character-to-character interactions. Through analysis of the centrality test. It was identified that Tang Seng (Tang Sancang) is the most centralized character. With 42 distinct connections, Tang Seng has the highest number of direct relationships with other characters in the story. This suggests that Tang Seng interacts with a wide range of individuals, making him a crucial figure in the narrative. These connections could represent alliances, conflicts, or various types of interactions that contribute to the overall development of the story. Tang Seng also had the highest degree of betweenness centrality with a count of 52. This indicates that Tang Seng acts as a key intermediary between other characters in the network. In the context of "Journey to the West," this implies that Tang Seng often serves as a mediator or facilitator of interactions between different characters. 

On the other hand, one of the most iconic characters Song Wukong has the second highest number of connections with 30 distinct connections (degree of centrality) and a degree of betweenness of 40. This indicates that Wukong also engages with a substantial portion of the character network. The interesting difference is that Wukong has a higher degree of betweenness compared to centrality. His presence on many of the shortest paths between other characters indicates that he plays a pivotal role in facilitating communication, interactions, and the flow of information among different individuals. In the context of the plot of the story, this indicates that he may be instrumental in resolving conflicts, negotiating alliances, or guiding the group through challenges.

It is surprising that the other disciples, namely Zhu Bajie (the pig), Sha Wujing (the water buffalo), and the horse, have a similar number of connections as Guanyin, the deity who sent Tang Seng on the journey. While a decrease in centrality was expected for minor characters, it was not anticipated for the disciples who are more prominently featured in the story. This unexpected result may indicate that the roles of the other disciples are not as emphasized or developed in terms of their interactions with other characters. Although they accompany Tang Seng on the pilgrimage, their connections may be more internally focused within the core group, rather than extending outward to a wider range of characters.

It is also interesting to note that most of antagonists in the story primarily interact with Tang Seng and have limited interactions with each other, which further emphasizes his pivotal role as the central character. The limited connections among the antagonists suggest their role as individual hurdles for Tang Seng rather than forming their own interactive cluster or group. This narrative choice maintains a cohesive and linear plot with few deviations from the overall quest.

### Character to event interaction 

The statistical analysis and mapping of the character and event interaction network in "Journey to the West" reveal intriguing findings that complement the previous examination of character centrality. Alongside the characters, certain events and locations within the story exhibit significant influence on the overall narrative.

One notable node that emerges from the analysis is Xi Tian, the destination of the journey within the story. Xin Tian stands out with a high degree of centrality, indicating its extensive connections to various characters and events (Labatut & Bost, 2019). With a centrality degree of 43 connections, Xin Tian's significance becomes evident. It suggests that this location plays a pivotal role in the development of the plot, serving as a central hub and connection for character interactions, story progression, or key events. Furthermore, Xin Tian demonstrates a considerable betweenness centrality of 15. This finding indicates that Xin Tian acts as a crucial intermediary or bridge within the character and event network. It serves as a focal point that facilitates interactions and influences the flow of the narrative. Through Xin Tian, characters may converge, conflicts may arise, or crucial plot points may unfold.

Additionally, analyzing the connections between characters in "Journey to the West" and their associated locations can provide insights into the spatial and geographical aspects of the narrative. It may reveal patterns, motifs, or symbolic representations associated with specific regions or landmarks (Jones, 2019). For example, with many connections in the network, Pingding Shan represents a transitional space where mortal and immortal realms intersect, and it becomes a crucial point in the narrative where the characters traverse between different worlds. Rivers, such as the Liusha, also hold symbolic significance. represents the dangers and obstacles they encounter on their journey, both physically and metaphorically. The river symbolizes the turbulent nature of life and the need for perseverance and determination to overcome difficulties. Characters connections to these places not only underlines the symbolic challenges they must overcome, but also enriching our understanding of China’s rich landscape and its relationship to Chinese culture.

Furthermore, characters have distinct connections to various locations outside of Tang Seng’s edge network. This could indicate that these locations are related to the origin, background, and purpose of each character. For example, Sun Wukong has a distinct connection to Wuxin Shan, the place of his imprisonment that no other character shares. This suggests that side characters in "Journey to the West" have their own stories and lore beyond the main narrative. Further analysis can explore the connections between these characters and other relevant works in Chinese literature and mythology, revealing intertextual relationships and cultural references. The result from this analysis could reveal shared narratives, archetypes, and symbolic meanings outside of the researched text. 

## Discussion 

The analysis of the character-to-character interactions and the inclusion of locations in the network provide valuable insights into the structure and dynamics of "Journey to the West." By examining the centrality measures, such as degree and betweenness centrality, we gain a deeper understanding of the characters' roles, relationships, and contributions to the overall narrative (Labatut & Bost, 2019). The identification of Tang Seng as the most centralized character, along with the significant roles of Sun Wukong and Xin Tian, highlights their importance in driving the story forward. The findings support the idea that Tang Seng acts as the central figure, connecting various characters and events, while also shedding light on the influence of specific locations within the narrative.

While the project offers valuable insights, it is essential to acknowledge its limitations. Firstly, the analysis relies on the available version for the "Journey to the West". Newer adaptations, interpretations, or variations of the story may introduce additional characters, events, or locations that were not considered in this analysis. Additionally, the project's analysis assumes that the character and event interactions are most accurately represented in the data. However, interpretations and adaptations of the story can vary, leading to potential discrepancies in character relationships and the importance of specific events or locations across different versions. 

Furthermore, the centrality measures used in the analysis provide quantitative metrics but do not capture the nuanced aspects of character development or the intricacies of their interactions. Network analysis provides a structural perspective, but it may not fully capture the depth and complexity of the narrative, character motivations, or emotional dynamics. To further explore these connections network properties, tests such as clustering or community detection could be used. Exploring these aspects could provide additional insights into subgroups or thematic clusters within the story.

Despite these limitations, the project serves as a valuable exploration of the character-to-character and character-to-event interactions in "Journey to the West," offering a foundation for further research and analysis in understanding the story's structure and dynamics.
